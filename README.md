  Running Intstructions:

  Clone the repo to your local machine. In the command line navigate to the Lumia directory, run php -S localhost:8000 to set up temporary php server. Navigate to localhost:8000 in your web browser to view the site. 

  Database: The project requires a databse for user accounts. You will need to set up one and replace the MySQL queries throughout the php files to correspond to the table you create.

  The Google API was utilized as the core functionality of this site. View testRun.php to see example of the create event functionallity. Also view https://developers.google.com/calendar/overview to familiarize yourself with the API and buildout remaining features.
